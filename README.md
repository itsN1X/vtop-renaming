## Checklist (prolly won't ever happen unless we both bored)
- [ ] Create a python program that can take options while renaming for numbered files, using just topic names and whole lot of other shit when I'm dead bored.
- [ ] Look for simpler tools.
- [ ] Test current scripts/programs for multiple cases.
