# VTOP Renaming Utilities

Contains programs and scripts for file manager tools to clean filenames of files downloaded from student portal.

## Details of included scripts
[AdvancedRenamer/vtop_format_date.aren](AdvancedRenamer/vtop_format_date.aren) â€” AutoRenamer script that basically converts date from `DD-MMM-YYYY` format to `YYYY-MM-DD` format which is sortable by name.

## Checklist (prolly won't ever happen unless we both bored)
- [ ] Create a python program that can take options while renaming for numbered files, using just topic names and whole lot of other shit when I'm dead bored.
- [ ] Look for simpler tools.
- [ ] Test current scripts/programs for multiple cases.
